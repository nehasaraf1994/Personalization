This project implements two collaborative filtering algorithms - Neighborhood based and Model based. 

The dataset used: Amazon - Movies and TV - ratings only.


The dataset should be downloaded from the link : http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

The step to see the results for all the sample size is to run the main file for both the models. Main Files calls the model file and implement it for different traning and test sample.

Neighborhood model has been built from scratch. Please refer to the documentation for further details.
